# Bird Bouncer
 This handy machine makes it so chickens do not make your nice cement pad turn into the poop deck. The innovative machine tracks chickens, and detects if they go on your precious cement pad, and if they do, the 'Bird Bouncer' will soak them, making them regret their decision to ever go on the cement pad.
